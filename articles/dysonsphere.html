		Dyson Sphere
		<div class="atopic">
			A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that completely encompasses a star
			and captures a large percentage of its power output. The concept is a thought
			experiment that attempts to explain how a spacefaring civilization would meet its
			energy requirements once those requirements exceed what can be generated from the home
			planet's resources alone. Only a tiny fraction of a star's energy emissions reach
			the surface of any orbiting planet. Building structures encircling a star would enable
			a civilization to harvest far more energy.

			<h1>Theory Concept</h1>
			The concept of the Dyson sphere was the result of an interesting experiment by physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson, 
			when he theorized that all technological civilizations constantly increased their demand for energy. He reasoned that 
			if human civilization expanded energy demands long enough, there would come a time when it demanded the total energy 
			output of the Sun. He proposed a system of orbiting structures (which he referred to initially as a shell) designed to 
			intercept and collect all energy produced by the Sun. Dyson's proposal did not detail how such a system would be constructed, 
			but focused only on issues of energy collection, on the basis that such a structure could be distinguished by its unusual 
			emission spectrum in comparison to a star. His 1960 paper "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation", 
			published in the journal Science, is credited with being the first to formalize the concept of the Dyson sphere.
			However, Dyson was not the first to advance this idea. He was inspired by the 1937 science fiction novel Star Maker.<br>
			
			<h1>Construction - Theory implementation</h1>
			Although such a megastructure is far beyond humanity's engineering capacity , plans that describe possible ways to build such 
			an enormous project have been made. The most feasible one would be to launch panels towards the star which must be extremely cheap 
			to make and extremely light so that it would be easier and would require less energy to be transferred. Scientists proposed that instead 
			of using the standart transportation mean in space ( rockets ) they would use a tube that would accelerate the objects and send 
			them to orbit towards the star and then it would collect the energy in order to make the next panel then the two would make four and 
			so on.<br>
			<br>
			But this is easier said than done.
